	abstract = {High speed legged locomotion involves high acceleration and extensive loadings of the leg, which impose critical challenges in actuator design. We introduce actuator dimensional analysis for maximizing torque density and transmission `transparency'. A front leg prototype developed based on insight from the analysis is evaluated for direct proprioceptive force control without force sensors. The vertical stiffness controlled leg was tested on a material testing device to calibrate the mechanical impedance of the leg. By compensating transmission impedance from commanded torque, the leg was able to estimate impact force. For the impact test, the mean absolute error as a ratio of full scale sensor force is 0.041 in the 3406 N/m stiffness experiment and is 0.049 in the 5038 N/m experiment. The results indicate that prescribed force profile control is possible during high speed locomotion.},

	abstract = {ATRIAS is a human-scale 3D-capable bipedal robot designed to mechanically embody the spring-mass model for dynamic walking and running. To help bring the extensive work on this theoretical model further into practice, we present the design and validation of a spring-mass robot that can operate in real-world settings (i.e. off-tether and without planarizing restraints). We outline the mechanisms and design choices necessary to meet these specifications, particularly ATRIAS' four-bar series-elastic leg design. We experimentally demonstrate the following robot capabilities, which are characteristics of the target model. 1) We present the robot's physical capability for both grounded and aerial gaits, including planar walking and sustained hopping, while being more efficient than similarly gait-versatile bipeds. 2) The robot can be controlled by enforcing quantities derived from the simpler spring-mass model, such as leg angles and leg forces. 3) ATRIAS replicates the center-of-mass dynamics of human hopping and (novelly) walking, a key spring-mass model feature. Lastly, we present dynamically stable stepping in 3D without external support, demonstrating that this theoretical model has practical potential for real-world locomotion.},

@article{Hutter2013,
	abstract = {The present dissertation addresses the design and control of a quadrupedal robot that achieves locomotion skills ranging from static walking to dynamic running. By combining novel techniques in the field of system design, actua- tion, and control, this work is a step towards closing the gap between legged robotic devices and their natural counterparts. Inspired by nature, where elastic elements in muscles and tendons largely contribute to the impressive locomotion capabilities, the quadruped robot StarlETH is built mechanically compliant. In each of the twelve joints, se- rial springs provide the necessary robustness to perform dynamic maneuvers. They improve energetic efficiency by intermittently storing energy, and they enable precise torque control for elaborate interaction with the environment. We specifically engineer the mechanical properties of the actuators to sup- port the natural dynamics of running gaits and provide low-level control techniques to precisely regulate the joint torque and position. The performance of the applied design, actuation, and low-level control approach is evaluated in planar single leg hopping experiments. To this end, the motion is generated and stabilized by emulating bio-inspired locomotion templates. Thereby, the leg can passively recover as much as 64{\%} of the energy, while the peak power and speed at the joint are more than four times higher than at the corresponding motor. These findings are highly consistent with different biomechanical studies and the underlying control principles can be directly extended to multi-legged systems. Legged systems continuously interact with their surroundings through multiple permanently changing contact points in order to keep balance or propel themselves forward. Dealing with the corresponding high-dimensional, nonlinear, non-smooth and underactuated system dynamics represents a very challenging control problem. In this context, we present a hierarchical task- space inverse dynamics framework that is based on projected, support con- sistent equations of motion. Using prioritized least square optimization, the complex behavior of a robotic system evolves through simultaneous execution of different motion tasks such as ensuring stability, moving a foot point, or keeping certain posture while optimally distributing the joint torques or contact forces. The proposed method is evaluated in a series of experiments on the de- veloped quadrupedal robot StarlETH. Static locomotion is optimized with respect to energetic efficiency or robustness against slippage while handling position and torque saturation limitations. Even on rough terrain, the robot can robustly walk by exploiting internal force directions. It can smoothly change its contact situation by interpolating between subsequent stance con- figurations. Building on similar principles as for single legged hopping, the quadruped is able to perform dynamic trotting gaits even under substantial external disturbances such as an unanticipated change in ground elevation or a kick on the main body. The experimental section is concluded with en- ergetic measurements during long term trotting and followed by a discussion and comparison with the biological counterparts.},
