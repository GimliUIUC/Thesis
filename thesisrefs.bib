Here, quadcopter dynamics are explored through the classical nonlinear equations of motion. Next, quadcopter is designed, built and assembled using off-the-shelf, low-cost products to carry a camera payload which is mainly utilized for any type of surveillance missions. System identification of the quadcopter dynamics is accomplished through the use of sweep data and {\$}CIFER{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcircledR{\}}{\$} to obtain the dynamic model. The unstable, non-linear quadcopter dynamics are stabilized using a generic control algorithm through the novel Arduino based software architecture.

A simple impulse planning algorithm is proposed to design vertical and horizontal force profiles which make net impulse on the system during one cycle zero. This design of force profiles leads to the conservation of linear momentum over a complete step, providing periodicity in horizontal and vertical velocity. When designed profiles are applied to the system, periodic orbits with an ability to change running speed are obtained. A virtual compliance control in the horizontal and vertical direction has been added onto the designed force profiles to stabilize the periodic orbits. The experimental results show that the algorithm successfully achieved untethered 3D running of the MIT Cheetah 2, with speeds ranging from 0 m/sec to 4.5 m/sec on treadmills as well as on grassy fields.},

	abstract = {Results of mechanical analyses of running may be helpful in the search for the etiology of running injuries. In this study a mechanical analysis was made of the landing phase of three trained heel-toe runners, running at their preferred speed and style. The body was modeled as a system of seven linked rigid segments, and the positions of markers defining these segments were monitored using 200 Hz video analysis. Information about the ground reaction force vector was collected using a force plate. Segment kinematics were combined with ground reaction force data for calculation of the net intersegmental forces and moments. The vertical component of the ground reaction force vector Fz was found to reach a first peak approximately 25 ms after touch-down. This peak occurs because, in the support leg, the vertical acoeleration of the knee joint is not reduced relative to that of the ankle joint by rotation of the lower leg, so that the support leg segments collide with the floor. Rotation of the support upper leg, however, reduces the vertical acceleration of the hip joint relative to that of the knee joint, and thereby plays an important role in limiting the vertical forces during the first 40 ms. Between 40 and 100 ms after touch-down, the vertical forces are mainly limited by rotation of the support lower leg. At the instant that Fz reaches its first peak, net moments about ankle, knee and hip joints of the support leg are virtually zero. The net moment about the knee joint changed from -100 Nm (flexion) at touch-down to +200 Nm (extension) 50 ms after touch-down. These changes are too rapid to be explained by variations in the muscle activation levels and were ascribed to spring-like behavior of pre-activated knee flexor and knee extensor muscles. These results imply that the runners investigated had no opportunity to control the rotations of body segments during the first part of the contact phase, other than by selecting a certain geometry of the body and muscular (co-)activation levels prior to touch-down. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Advanced control design can increase the transparency of the haptic device at the haptic interface thereby increasing the realism of the simulation. Force feedback also enables the implementation of admittance control approaches heretofore considered the domain of large robotic platforms. The quality of the haptic interface is "rst quanti"ed, and the standard open-loop impedance approach to haptic control is reviewed. Dual-input control schemes with sensory force feedback are then introduced, and the resulting quality of the haptic interface is derived. A four-bar linkage example is used to illustrate the im- provement in "delity realized with the various approaches. The tradeoffs encountered in moving to force feedback controllers for haptic applications are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Locomotion results from complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, dynamically coupled interactions between an organism and its environment. Fortunately, simple models we call templates have been and can be made to resolve the redundancy of multiple legs, joints and muscles by seeking synergies and symmetries. A template is the simplest model (least number of variables and parameters) that exhibits a targeted behavior. For example, diverse species that differ in skeletal type, leg number and posture run in a stable manner like sagittal- and horizontal-plane spring-mass systems. Templates suggest control strategies that can be tested against empirical data. Templates must be grounded in more detailed morphological and physiological models to ask specific questions about multiple legs, the joint torques that actuate them, the recruitment of muscles that produce those torques and the neural networks that activate the ensemble. We term these more elaborate models anchors. They introduce representations of specific biological details whose mechanism of coordination is of interest. Since mechanisms require controls, anchors incorporate specific hypotheses concerning the manner in which unnecessary motion or energy from legs, joints and muscles is removed, leaving behind the behavior of the body in the low-degree-of-freedom template. Locating the origin of control is a challenge because neural and mechanical systems are dynamically coupled and both play a role. The control of slow, variable-frequency locomotion appears to be dominated by the nervous system, whereas during rapid, rhythmic locomotion, the control may reside more within the mechanical system. Anchored templates of many-legged, sprawled-postured animals suggest that passive, dynamic self-stabilization from a feedforward, tuned mechanical system can reject rapid perturbations and simplify control. Future progress would benefit from the creation of a field embracing comparative neuromechanics.},

	abstract = {Although the effects of body size on mammalian locomotion are well documented, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we present a computational model of the mechanics, control and energetics that unifies some well-known scale effects in running quadrupeds. The model consists of dynamic, physics-based simulations of six running mammals ranging in size from a chipmunk to a horse (0.115-676 kg). The 'virtual animals' are made up of rigid segments (head, trunk and four legs) linked by joints and are similar in morphology to particular species. In the model, each stance limb acts as a spring operating within a narrow range of stiffness, forward motion is powered and controlled by active hip and shoulder torques, and metabolic cost is predicted from the time course of supporting body weight. Model parameters that are important for stability (joint stiffnesses, limb-retraction times and target positions and velocities of the limbs) are selected such that (i) running kinematics (aerial height, forward speed and body pitch) is smooth and periodic and (ii) overall leg stiffness is in agreement with published data. Both trotting and galloping gaits are modeled, and comparisons across size are made at speeds that are physiologically similar among species. Model predictions are in agreement with data on vertical stiffness, limb angles, metabolic cost of transport, stride frequency, peak force and duty factor. This work supports the idea that a single, integrative model can predict important features of running across size by employing simple strategies to control overall leg stiffness. More broadly, the model provides a quantitative framework for testing hypotheses that relate limb control, stability and metabolic cost.},

	abstract = {In this study the effects of systematic manipulations of control and muscle strength on vertical jump height were investigated. Forward dynamic simulations of vertical squat jumps were performed with a model of the human musculoskeletal system. Model input was STIM(t), stimulation of six lower extremity muscles as function of time; model output was body motion. The model incorporated all features of the musculoskeletal system of human test subjects considered salient for vertical jumping, and the initial body configuration was set equal to that of the test subjects. First, optimal STIM(t) was found for a standard version of the model (experiment A). A satisfactory correspondence was found between simulation results and kinematics, kinetics and electromyograms of the test subjects. Subsequently, optimal STIM(t) for the standard model was used to drive a model with strengthened muscles (experiment B). Jump height was now lower than that found in experiment A. Finally, optimal STIM(t) was found for the model with strengthened muscles (experiment C). Jump height was now higher than that found in experiment A. These results suggest that in order to take full benefit of an increase in muscle strength, control needs to be adapted. It is speculated that in training programs aimed at improving jumping achievement, muscle training exercises should be accompanied by exercises that allow athletes to practice with their changed muscles.},

	abstract = {The gallop differs from most other quadrupedal gaits in that each limb plays a unique role. This study compares the ground forces applied by the four limbs and uses force differences between limbs to address the question of why the gallop is the fastest quadrupedal gait. Individual ground forces were recorded from each of the four limbs as six dogs galloped down a runway at constant speed. Trials were videotaped at high speed using a camera positioned perpendicular to the runway, and velocity was measured using photosensors. The trailing forelimb applied greater peak vertical forces than the lead forelimb, however the vertical impulses from the two forelimbs were similar because the lead forelimb had a longer contact interval. The trailing forelimb and lead hindlimb applied greater peak accelerating forces and accelerating force impulses than their contralateral limbs despite their tendency to have shorter contact intervals. The accelerating impulse of both forelimbs combined did not differ significantly from that of both hindlimbs. The forelimbs applied a greater decelerating impulse than the hindlimbs, such that their net fore-aft impulse was decelerating whereas that of the hindlimbs was accelerating. The greater accelerating impulse applied by the trailing forelimb and greater decelerating impulse applied by the lead forelimb are consistent with the forelimbs acting as elastic struts rather than being actively retracted. In contrast, greater accelerating forces were produced by the lead hindlimb while the center of mass was lifted, suggesting that the hindlimbs are more actively extended or retracted during stance. The differences in ground forces measured between paired limbs suggest that the lead forelimb and trailing hindlimb are limited in their ability to apply forces by their positions in the stride cycle rather than by their muscular capacity. Although a bound or half-bound would allow more limbs to produce their maximal forces, a gallop may generate higher speeds because it is more efficient. Galloping could be more efficient than other gaits involving sagittal bending if the increased number of ground contact intervals decreased either the decelerating forces applied at the onset of ground contact or the vertical motion of the center of mass.},

We experimentally demonstrate the following robot capabilities, which are characteristics of the target model. 1) We present the robot's physical capability for both grounded and aerial gaits, including planar walking and sustained hopping, while being more efficient than similarly gait-versatile bipeds. 2) The robot can be controlled by enforcing quantities derived from the simpler spring-mass model, such as leg angles and leg forces. 3) ATRIAS replicates the center-of-mass dynamics of human hopping and (novelly) walking, a key spring-mass model feature. Lastly, we present dynamically stable stepping in 3D without external support, demonstrating that this theoretical model has practical potential for real-world locomotion.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether the difference in jump height between countermovement jumps (CMJ) and squat jumps (SJ) could be explained by a difference in active state during propulsion. METHODS: Simulations were performed with a model of the human musculoskeletal system comprising four body segments and six muscles. The model's only input was STIM, the stimulation of muscles, which could be switched "off" or "on." After switching "on," STIM increased to its maximum at a fixed rate of change (dSTIM/dt). For various values of dSTIM/dt, stimulation switch times were optimized to produce a maximum height CMJ. From this CMJ, the configuration at the lowest height of the center of gravity (CG) was selected and used as static starting configuration for simulation of SJ. Next, STIM-switch times were optimized to find the maximum height SJ. RESULTS: Simulated CMJ and SJ closely resembled jumps of human subjects. Maximum jump height of the model was greater in CMJ than in SJ, with the difference ranging from 0.4 cm at infinitely high dSTIM/dt to about 2.5 cm at the lowest dSTIM/dt investigated. The greater jump height in CMJ was due to a greater work output of the hip extensor muscles. These muscles could produce more force and work over the first 30{\%} of their shortening range in CMJ, due to the fact that they had a higher active state in CMJ than in SJ. CONCLUSION: The greater jump height in CMJ than in SJ could be explained by the fact that in CMJ active state developed during the preparatory countermovement, whereas in SJ it inevitably developed during the propulsion phase, so that the muscles could produce more force and work during shortening in CMJ.},

The jumps were recorded on highspeed film (500 Hz) combined with registration of ground reaction forces, and net joint moments were calculated by inverse dynamics. The purpose was to investigate the choice of strategy in two standard jumps, squat jump and countermovement jump. The volleyball jump was performed with a sequential strategy and the ballet jump was performed with a simultaneous strategy. In the two standard jumps, the choice of strategy was individual and not related to training background. This was additionally confirmed in a test of seven ballet dancers and seven volleyball players.},

@article{Bobbert2013,
	abstract = {Jump height, defined as vertical displacement in the airborne phase, depends on vertical takeoff velocity. For centuries, researchers have speculated on how jump height is affected by body size and many have adhered to what has come to be known as Borelli's law, which states that jump height does not depend on body size per se. The underlying assumption is that the amount of work produced per kg body mass during the push-off is independent of size. However, if a big body is isometrically downscaled to a small body, the latter requires higher joint angular velocities to achieve a given takeoff velocity and work production will be more impaired by the force-velocity relationship of muscle. In the present study, the effects of pure isometric scaling on vertical jumping performance were investigated using a biologically realistic model of the human musculoskeletal system. The input of the model, muscle stimulation over time, was optimized using jump height as criterion. It was found that when the human model was miniaturized to the size of a mouse lemur, with a mass of about one-thousandth that of a human, jump height dropped from 40 cm to only 6 cm, mainly because of the force-velocity relationship. In reality, mouse lemurs achieve jump heights of about 33 cm. By implication, the unfavourable effects of the small body size of mouse lemurs on jumping performance must be counteracted by favourable effects of morphological and physiological adaptations. The same holds true for other small jumping animals. The simulations for the first time expose and explain the sheer magnitude of the isolated effects of isometric downscaling on jumping performance, to be counteracted by morphological and physiological adaptations.},

	abstract = {Jumping and landing movements are characterized by large instantaneous forces, short duration, and a high uncertainty concerning take off and landing points. Such characteristics make conventional types of control and robot design inadequate. Here we present an approach to realize motor control of jumping and landing which exploits the synergy between control and mechanical structure. Our experimental system is a pneumatically actuated bipedal robot called "Mowgli". Mowgli's artificial musculoskeletal system consists of six McKibben pneumatic muscle actuators including bi-articular muscle and two legs with hip, knee, and ankle joints. Mowgli can reach jump heights of more than 50{\%} of its body height and can land softly. Our results show a proximo-distal sequence of joint extensions during jumping despite simultaneous motor activity. Extensions in the whole body motion are caused by the compliance and the natural dynamics of the legs. In addition to the experiments with the real robot, we also simulated two types of open loop controllers for vertical jumping with disturbance. We found that the model controlled by open loop motor command through a muscle-tendon mechanism could jump robustly. The simulation results demonstrate the contribution of the artificial musculoskeletal system as a physical feedback loop in explosive movements.},

Despite this tradition, reducing interface stiffness offers a number of advantages, including greater shock tolerance, lower reflected inertia, more accurate and stable force control, less inadvertent damage to the environment, and the capacity for energy storage. As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, the authors propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element within the actuator is a good idea. The authors use the term elasticity instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent in series elastic actuators, the authors present a control system for their use under general force or impedance control. The authors conclude with test results from a revolute series-elastic actuator meant for the arms of the MIT humanoid robot Cog and for a small planetary rover},

@article{Full1999,
	abstract = {Locomotion results from complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, dynamically coupled interactions between an organism and its environment. Fortunately, simple models we call templates have been and can be made to resolve the redundancy of multiple legs, joints and muscles by seeking synergies and symmetries. A template is the simplest model (least number of variables and parameters) that exhibits a targeted behavior. For example, diverse species that differ in skeletal type, leg number and posture run in a stable manner like sagittal- and horizontal-plane spring-mass systems. Templates suggest control strategies that can be tested against empirical data. Templates must be grounded in more detailed morphological and physiological models to ask specific questions about multiple legs, the joint torques that actuate them, the recruitment of muscles that produce those torques and the neural networks that activate the ensemble. We term these more elaborate models anchors. They introduce representations of specific biological details whose mechanism of coordination is of interest. Since mechanisms require controls, anchors incorporate specific hypotheses concerning the manner in which unnecessary motion or energy from legs, joints and muscles is removed, leaving behind the behavior of the body in the low-degree-of-freedom template. Locating the origin of control is a challenge because neural and mechanical systems are dynamically coupled and both play a role. The control of slow, variable-frequency locomotion appears to be dominated by the nervous system, whereas during rapid, rhythmic locomotion, the control may reside more within the mechanical system. Anchored templates of many-legged, sprawled-postured animals suggest that passive, dynamic self-stabilization from a feedforward, tuned mechanical system can reject rapid perturbations and simplify control. Future progress would benefit from the creation of a field embracing comparative neuromechanics.},

@article{Hubicki2016,
	abstract = {ATRIAS is a human-scale 3D-capable bipedal robot designed to mechanically embody the spring-mass model for dynamic walking and running. To help bring the extensive work on this theoretical model further into practice, we present the design and validation of a spring-mass robot that can operate in real-world settings (i.e. off-tether and without planarizing restraints). We outline the mechanisms and design choices necessary to meet these specifications, particularly ATRIAS' four-bar series-elastic leg design. We experimentally demonstrate the following robot capabilities, which are characteristics of the target model. 1) We present the robot's physical capability for both grounded and aerial gaits, including planar walking and sustained hopping, while being more efficient than similarly gait-versatile bipeds. 2) The robot can be controlled by enforcing quantities derived from the simpler spring-mass model, such as leg angles and leg forces. 3) ATRIAS replicates the center-of-mass dynamics of human hopping and (novelly) walking, a key spring-mass model feature. Lastly, we present dynamically stable stepping in 3D without external support, demonstrating that this theoretical model has practical potential for real-world locomotion.},

@article{Hutter2013,
	abstract = {The present dissertation addresses the design and control of a quadrupedal robot that achieves locomotion skills ranging from static walking to dynamic running. By combining novel techniques in the field of system design, actua- tion, and control, this work is a step towards closing the gap between legged robotic devices and their natural counterparts. Inspired by nature, where elastic elements in muscles and tendons largely contribute to the impressive locomotion capabilities, the quadruped robot StarlETH is built mechanically compliant. In each of the twelve joints, se- rial springs provide the necessary robustness to perform dynamic maneuvers. They improve energetic efficiency by intermittently storing energy, and they enable precise torque control for elaborate interaction with the environment. We specifically engineer the mechanical properties of the actuators to sup- port the natural dynamics of running gaits and provide low-level control techniques to precisely regulate the joint torque and position. The performance of the applied design, actuation, and low-level control approach is evaluated in planar single leg hopping experiments. To this end, the motion is generated and stabilized by emulating bio-inspired locomotion templates. Thereby, the leg can passively recover as much as 64{\%} of the energy, while the peak power and speed at the joint are more than four times higher than at the corresponding motor. These findings are highly consistent with different biomechanical studies and the underlying control principles can be directly extended to multi-legged systems. Legged systems continuously interact with their surroundings through multiple permanently changing contact points in order to keep balance or propel themselves forward. Dealing with the corresponding high-dimensional, nonlinear, non-smooth and underactuated system dynamics represents a very challenging control problem. In this context, we present a hierarchical task- space inverse dynamics framework that is based on projected, support con- sistent equations of motion. Using prioritized least square optimization, the complex behavior of a robotic system evolves through simultaneous execution of different motion tasks such as ensuring stability, moving a foot point, or keeping certain posture while optimally distributing the joint torques or contact forces. The proposed method is evaluated in a series of experiments on the de- veloped quadrupedal robot StarlETH. Static locomotion is optimized with respect to energetic efficiency or robustness against slippage while handling position and torque saturation limitations. Even on rough terrain, the robot can robustly walk by exploiting internal force directions. It can smoothly change its contact situation by interpolating between subsequent stance con- figurations. Building on similar principles as for single legged hopping, the quadruped is able to perform dynamic trotting gaits even under substantial external disturbances such as an unanticipated change in ground elevation or a kick on the main body. The experimental section is concluded with en- ergetic measurements during long term trotting and followed by a discussion and comparison with the biological counterparts.},
